    <p><span style="font: 36px;font-weight: bold ; text-indent: 20px;">Hello </span> my name is Jose Gonzalez and I live in McAllen Tx and I'm currently pursuing a career in IT at South Texas College and hope to work with computers and technology in the future.

        <p><span style="font: 36px;font-weight: bold ; text-indent: 20px;">My </span> summer time was not the longest as I decided I wanted to take classes during it to get ahead in my academic goals however I still got to experience some cool things.
            I traveled to Florida and went to Disney for the first time, I think the parks there are great and I especially enjoyed the Guardians of the Galaxy Rollercoaster they had at the EPCOT park.
            Overall, I enjoyed my short break in Florida and I'm refreshed and ready to get back on track with my goals in life.
