      <p class="card-text">I think that many students struggle to find what they really want to major in when going to college 
        including myself. I was initially pursuing a career in English as I believed it to be the subject I was best at however
        over time I realized that I wanted to study something I really enjoyed even if it was something I wasn't the best at. 
        This is one of many reasons why I'm taking this course as it's part of a degree that relates to computers as I've figured
        out that this is what I really enjoy doing. I hope that others can find what they enjoy doing academically and they should
        consider pursuing that.

        <p class="card-text">Over the last few decades, People have made great advancements in technology and it almost appears that 
          ideas of fiction from movies and books of a future with AI and the sort are more possible with each year that passes. Although
          the idea of flying cars and robots have always sounded interesting in media, I believe it's equally as impressive how far computers
          have come and what the future might hold for them. Computers have been able to achieve more and more each year and they are getting smaller
          and smaller that they now fit in our pocket. I believe that the future that computers hold are still unknown however I theorize That
          we wil able to accomplish much more tasks in an easier, faster and more understood methods.
