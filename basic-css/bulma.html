                    You could say that my history with computers started at a very young age with the Nintendo 64, Although the N64 is an old 
                    retro console that does not resemble a typical computer, it carries out functions in a basic manner code in order 
                    to produce pixels on a screen that you could play. This sort of technology has always amazed me and through the years
                    I've never lost interest in how computers function. That is why I'm currently pursuing a career in IT as it relates to computers
                    and I hope that in the future I can help others as well as myself understand more about computers and allow people to discover
                    what they can do with them as well as improve their use with them. If you'd like me to answer any questions you may have you may
                    contact me at my email  <a>jose.christian28@gmail.com</a>.

                    So far this 1315 Computer Progamming course with Professor Velasco has been very interesting. Although I'm finding it on certain days
                    difficult to keep up with the material, I believe I'm doing a good job submitting my assignments on time and I expected these courses
                    I'm taking not to be any less difficult than what they are as summer courses cover much more content in a shorter amount of time. I've 
                    already learned so much about basic coding and even though it can be frustrating to not understand why something isn't working out, there
                    is a certain feeling of success that comes when you do finally figure it out. Regardless, I hope that the rest of the summer goes well
                    and I wish the best for my peers and myself.
